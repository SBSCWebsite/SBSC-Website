            <h4>The department values an interdisciplinary activity-based approach which offers opportunities to explore and experience language through active involvement. Our Vision is to empower our students to become full participants in a fast-changing global environment by promoting linguistic, communication and transferable skills. Our mission is to develop in our students a sensitivity for the English language and literature by promoting language skills through a variety of traditional and innovative tools and strategies.
            We, in the department are convinced that language learning is dynamic and vibrant, hence it cannot be confined to the classroom. Community service projects such as the setting up of mini libraries to promote the reading culture in rural areas, helping needy children and civic engagement towards environmental sustainability are some of the projects undertaken by our department. Active participation and commitment to a team with a shared vision ,not only helped our students develop social and collaborative skills ,but also increased their sense of  social awareness and responsibility thus translating academic issues into concrete actions and lifetime experiences .A multi-disciplinary approach has also allowed us to address other challenges facing our modern youth such as depression ,isolation and anti-social behaviours – hence , making space for pastoral care and cater for our students’ wellbeing ,which remain our core values. The psychological, cognitive and emotional benefits derived by contributing positively to the community have definitely helped our students to develop a higher self-esteem, communicate with confidence and in the process, enhance academic performance as well. Public speaking, MUN, Drama, Youth Parliament, Debates and Elocutions are integral parts of the English language and EGP curriculum at SBA. Optimum use of the multi-media lab and ICT resources is made, thus making language and literature learning fun and dynamic.
            Last but not the least, Educators of the English department seize this opportunity to thank the school administration, the Rector and D. Rector in particular, for their support, faith in the department, the abundant opportunities for growth and for going the extra mile for the wellbeing of our students. These have been vital contributing factors to the fulfilling of our mission and to keep us motivated, despite the various challenges facing language educators.</h4>

            Aussi, nous croyons à l’épanouissement de l’apprenant dans tous les domaines constituant sa personnalité. De ce fait nous intégrons des activités de culture générale, d'éloquence, et de productions filmographiques afin de permettre aux étudiants d’étendre leurs capacités fonctionnelles tout en enrichissant leurs qualités socio-culturelles.
            Ainsi, notre stratégie vise à construire des aptitudes de travail autonomes aussi bien que collectif chez les apprenants du français au sein de SBSC. De surcroit, notre philosophie tient à engager nos étudiants sereinement sur la voie de la curiosité en encourageant leur pensée logique et créative par l’intermédiaire de la langue de Molière.
            Pour mettre en œuvre notre mission, nous valorisons l’approche collaborative avec l’administration de l'école, la coopération interdisciplinaire entre les départements de SBSC aussi bien que les parents et des acteurs socio-éducatifs. Au sein du département, l’esprit d’équipe est à la base de notre action pour d’atteindre nos objectifs communs.</h4>

				The Chemistry department actually consists of 2 full time educators and two lab ancilliaries.  Classes are run for grade 10, grade 11, grade 12 and grade 13   students. This constitute a total of around 200 students who are accommodated in two laboratories for their respective lessons. The labs are well equipped with common lab apparatus and chemicals for carrying out demonstration and practical classes.

				Educators in this department are fully conscious of the challenges awaiting our young adults as they will step out of school. Chemistry lessons are carried out with a mission to encourage learners to become confident citizens who can make informed decisions in a competitive world and in novel situations.

				Lessons are geared to enable learners to develop transferable and higher order thinking skills including handling data, practical problem-solving skills and applying the scientific method. Learners are also encouraged to work collaboratively with others through group work and sharing of ideas amongst peers.

				Last but not least, since ‘A Day Without Chemistry’ does not exist, non-science students need also to understand the relevance and effects of their everyday actions on their environment. Hence the need to adopt the ‘Science for All’ approach for a better world. With strong evidence of drastic effects of climate change in recent years, students need to be more conscious of their actions and their valuable contribution to bring about changes for the better in terms of the 3Rs: reduce, reuse and recycle.  Activity periods will be used to raise environmental consciousness among all students.

			<h4>Cambridge International Travel and Tourism is ideal for students seeking to specialise in this subject. In 2020, Sookdeo Bissondoyal State College introduced Travel and Tourism at Grade 10 level. The subject encourages students to appreciate the changing nature of travel and tourism and understand the importance of sustainability in the development and management of the industry. It is a dynamic and multidisciplinary subject. In 2023, a batch of G13 will sit for A-Level Travel and Tourism for the first time. One of the components is Paper 2 ‘Planning and Managing an event’, which develops learners’ practical and research skills through organising an actual tourism event, which will contribute to their further study and working in the industry.</h4>
